# Object Oriented Lab

## 1
In a previous exercise we sliced a piece of cloth for the elves to make a suit for Santa:

Modify the code by moving to an object oriented interface. The main method should look like this:

```
cloth = Cloth()

with open('input.txt') as input_file:
  for line in input_file:
    claim = Claim(line)
    cloth.mark(claim) 

criteria = Criteria(lambda claims: len(claims) > 1)

# Print how many squares are claimed by more than one elf
print(len(cloth.matching(criteria)))

# Print the ID of the only claim that doesn't overlap
criteria = Criteria(lambda claims: len(claims) == 1)
print(cloth.matching(criteria)[0].id)
```

Create a class called "BuildTarget" that represents an object file we're building. Each build target has "Dependencies" which are other "BuildTarget" objects. When building a BuildTarget we should first build all of its dependencies.

Let's assume that to build a "BuildTarget" we just need to print its name.

This is a sample code that uses the new class:

```
main = BuildTarget("main")

common = BuildTarget("common")
ui = BuildTarget("ui")

gui = BuildTarget("gui")
cli = BuildTarget("cli")

ui.depends_on(gui, cli)
gui.depends_on(common)
main.depends_on(common, ui)

main.build()
```

The code should print out a list of each BuildTarget as it builds them, and make sure not to build any target multiple times and to build each target before building other targets that require it.
