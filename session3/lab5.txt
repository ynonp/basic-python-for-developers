# Text and Binary Files Lab

In one of the previous labs we created a translation game that asks the user for the translation of a given word. Modify the game so it will save a rating for each word in a file, and when it shows the word will also present its rating.

For example if a user has already answered 5 times on the translation to the word "world" but only 3 of them were correct we should ask her the next time:

"Please translate the word "world" (score so far for this word is 3/5): "

1. Save the rating in a text file

2. Save the rating in a JSON file (using the "json" module)

3. Save the rating in a binary file

Which was your favorite method?
